        <h3>Level 1 – Foundations of Self-Protection (White and Yellow Belt)</h3>
        <p>Begin your adventure with a 64-class course in effective physical, intellectual, and emotional self-protection
            – an exciting excursion into empowering self development. To determine the 12 most common surprise attack ambush
            assaults likely to be thrown at good people by dangerous aggressors, we interviewed law enforcement officers,
            security professionals, nightclub doormen, emergency room doctors – and even coroners.
            We then designed our first phase of training to show you how to win in the 12 surprise attacks most likely to
            occur in a hostile confrontation, how to rescue other people in those 12 threat situations,
            how to use 12 natural body self-defense tools, and how to develop the grounded presence of focused command in
            high-pressure situations.</p>
        <h3>Level 2 – Advanced Self-Protection (Blue and Red Belt)</h3>
        <p>Build your skills in success-generating principles of personal confidence, ability to recognize potential danger as it
            builds, and capability to respond effectively under pressure as you explore a next-stage set of 24 advanced applications
            of winning skill and strategy. When it is not a surprise attack ambush and you know you must stay and defend yourself or
            someone else, you have to be trained and ready to win a fight. A 145 class course adds advanced concepts in fighting
            footwork and intelligent power, and shows you how to develop the eyes and mind to recognize danger as it builds so you
            can be in just the right place at just the right moment to control the conflict on your terms.</p>
        <h3>Level 3 – Path of the Protector Martial Arts (Green and Brown Belt)</h3>
        <p>Perfect your protector skills as your training evolves into a personal exploration of power — a path to self-mastery.
            Learn to use evasive lock-up captures to slip by danger and immobilize an aggressor on your terms, and render him incapable
            of continuing the fight. Your capacity and confidence evolve as you explore the third-step set of 24 more advanced
            applications in a 145 class course leading to Black Belt in To-Shin Do. You know you are living up to your fullest
            potential, the “exciting peace” of coming home to the truth of just how strong you really are.</p>
        <h3>Level 4 – Black Belt Mastery</h3>
        <p>Learning doesn’t stop at Black Belt – that’s where highest mastery begins!
            As a holder of the Black Belt, you will work on personalizing your training for a winning spirit in all of life’s
            challenges. Advanced skills include how to use less effort to generate more speed and power, how to respond with grace
            and intelligence when confronted with brutality and ignorance, how to rescue and protect others, and how to deal with
            multiple attackers, assailants with weapons, or aggressors skilled in street-fighting or other martial arts.</p>
